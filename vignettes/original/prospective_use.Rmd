The `summon_familiar` function is used to generate models for a given dataset
and provide a broad analysis afterwards. This creates a number of files. Many of
the files resulting from this analysis can also be used outside of
`summon_familiar`. For example, models and ensembles can be used prospectively
to assess new datasets. Likewise, data and collection objects can be used to
customise plotting and export to tables.

In this example we will use the *birthweight* dataset collected in 1986 at
Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts. This dataset contains
birth weight data from 189 newborn children, some of which have low birth weight
(less then 2.5 kg). Potential risk factors were also collected. We will try to
predict the low birth weight indicator using these risk factors.

We will first randomly split the data into development and validation
datasets:

```{r, results=FALSE, label="birthweight-data-preparation"}
# Load the birth weight data set
data <- data.table::as.data.table(MASS::birthwt)

# Add sample and batch identifiers.
data[, ":="("sample_id" = .I)]

# Generate training and validation samples
train_samples <- sample(data$sample_id, size = 120, replace = FALSE)
valid_samples <- setdiff(data$sample_id, train_samples)

# Assign batch identifiers.
data[sample_id %in% train_samples, "batch_id" := "development"]
data[sample_id %in% valid_samples, "batch_id" := "validation"]
```

Next we will prepare the dataset further. We drop the `bwt` column as this
directly contains the indicator we are trying to predict. Other columns are
encoded as categorical variables.

```{r, results=FALSE, label="birthweight-data-preparation-part-2"}
# Drop the bwt column.
data[, "bwt" := NULL]

# Encode the low outcome column: we ensure that "low" is now the so-called
# positive class.
data$low <- factor(data$low, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("normal", "low"))

# Encode race. smoke, ht, and ui columns as categorical variables.
data$race <- factor(data$race, levels = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c("white", "black", "other"))
data$smoke <- factor(data$smoke, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("no", "yes"))
data$ht <- factor(data$ht, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("no", "yes"))
data$ui <- factor(data$ui, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("no", "yes"))

# Rename columns to make them clearer.
data.table::setnames(
  x = data,
  old = c("low", "age", "lwt", "race", "smoke", "ptl", "ht", "ui", "ftv"),
  new = c(
    "birth_weight", "age_mother", "weight_mother_before_pregnancy",
    "ethnicity", "smoking_during_pregnancy", "previous_premature_labours",
    "hypertension_history", "uterine_irritability", "physician_visits_first_trimester"))
```

Then we call `summon_familiar` create models for the data and assess these. We
will create an ensemble of five penalised logistic regression models to
predict the low birth weight indicator, based on bootstraps of the development dataset. You
may notice that we here write to the temporary R directory using the `tempdir()`
function. In practice you will want to use a different directory, as the
temporary R directory will be deleted once your R session closes. For speed, we
will also only compute point estimates during evaluation (see the
*evaluation and explanation* vignette for other options).

```{r, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, label="birthweight-data-experiment-run"}
familiar::summon_familiar(
  data = data,
  project_dir = tempdir(),
  sample_id_column = "sample_id",
  batch_id_column = "batch_id",
  development_batch_id = "development",
  outcome_type = "binomial",
  outcome_column = "birth_weight",
  experimental_design = "bs(fs+mb,5) + ev",
  cluster_method = "none",
  vimp_method = "none",
  learner = "lasso",
  parallel = FALSE,
  estimation_type = "point")
```

# Using models prospectively

Models generated by familiar are stored in subdirectories of the `trained_models` folder:

```{r}
# Create path to the directory containing the models.
model_directory_path <- file.path(tempdir(), "trained_models", "lasso", "none")

# List files present in the directory.
list.files(model_directory_path)
```

There are 5 models in the directory, which are stored in RDS format in files ending with `*_model.RDS`. We can inspect the first model in the directory.

```{r}
# Create path to the model.
model_path <- file.path(model_directory_path, list.files(model_directory_path, pattern = "model")[1])

# Load the model.
model <- readRDS(model_path)
model
```

This model can then be used to predict values for a given dataset, among other things. The `predict` method used by familiar is in many ways similar to other `predict` methods. However, familiar requires that the `newdata` argument is set. It does not store development data with its models to limit model size and prevent leaking sensitive information. Predictions can be made as follows:

```{r}
predict(object = model, newdata = data)
```

In addition to default predictions, familiar allows for several different types
of prediction by setting the `type` argument. These are:

-   `"novelty"`: Infers the novelty of an instance using the novelty detector
trained with each model. This can be used to detect out-of-distribution samples
for which the model has to extrapolate.

-   `"survival_probability"`: Predict the probability of surviving until the
time specified by `time`. This is only possible for some survival models where
the predicted values can be transformed to survival probabilities.

-   `"risk_stratification"`: Predict the risk group to which an instance is
assigned. This is only possible for survival models. By default, stratification
takes place using threshold values established during model development. You can
manually specify one or more threshold values by setting the
`stratification_threshold` argument.

For example, we can predict novelty of the samples as follows:

```{r}
predict(object = model, newdata = data, type = "novelty")
```

More powerful however, is the ability to perform any of the evaluation and
explanation steps for a new dataset, including new settings. By default, all
evaluation and explanation steps are conducted using the settings defined when
running `summon_familiar`. In this case that means that point estimates will be
computed.

Let us for example compute and plot model performance AUC-ROC and accuracy for the model.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=14}
plots <- familiar::plot_model_performance(
  object = model,
  draw = TRUE,
  facet_by = "metric",
  data = data[batch_id == "validation"],
  metric = c("auc", "accuracy"))
```

You may notice that no plot is produced. This is because the type of plot
`violin_plot` and the `estimation_type` inherited from the model are
incompatible. However, nothing prevents us from changing the estimation type to
bootstrap confidence intervals `bci`.

```{r, label="prospective-model-performance-plot"}
# Draw model performance plots with bootstrap confidence intervals.
# familiar_data_names argument specifies the name that appears below the plot.
# The default is rather long.
plots <- familiar::plot_model_performance(
  object = model,
  draw = TRUE,
  facet_by = "metric",
  data = data[batch_id == "validation"],
  estimation_type = "bci",
  metric = c("auc", "accuracy"),
  familiar_data_names = "lasso")
```

Note that we can achieve the same result without explicitly importing the model.
Providing the path to the model as the `object` argument suffices:

```{r, label="prospective-model-performance-plot-implicit"}
plots <- familiar::plot_model_performance(
  object = model_path,
  draw = TRUE,
  facet_by = "metric",
  data = data[batch_id == "validation"],
  estimation_type = "bci",
  metric = c("auc", "accuracy"),
  familiar_data_names = "lasso")
```

# Using ensembles of models prospectively

The five models created in the example form an ensemble. Instead of
investigating the models separately, we can also evaluate the model ensemble.
Model ensembles generated by familiar are stored in the same subdirectory of the
`trained_models` folder as their constituent models:

```{r}
# List files present in the directory.
list.files(model_directory_path)
```

In this case there is only one ensemble in the directory, which is stored in RDS
format in a file ending with `*_ensemble.RDS`. Some alternative experiment
designs, e.g. ones involving cross-validation, can lead to multiple ensembles
being formed. We can inspect the ensemble in the directory.

```{r}
# Create path to the model.
ensemble_path <- file.path(
  model_directory_path,
  list.files(model_directory_path, pattern = "ensemble")[1])

# Load the model.
ensemble <- readRDS(ensemble_path)
ensemble
```

One can use ensembles of models for prediction:

```{r}
predict(object = ensemble, newdata = data)
```

Ensembles behave similarly to models during evaluation and explanation steps:

```{r, label="prospective-model-performance-plot-ensemble"}
plots <- familiar::plot_model_performance(
  object = ensemble,
  draw = TRUE,
  facet_by = "metric",
  data = data[batch_id == "validation"],
  estimation_type = "bci",
  metric = c("auc", "accuracy"),
  familiar_data_names = "lasso")
```

There is one important limitation to using ensembles. Normally, when loading an
ensemble, the models are not attached to the ensemble. Instead, the `model_list`
attribute of the ensemble object contains a list of paths to the location of the
model files at creation. Thus, if you move these files, the ensemble can no
longer find and attach the models. There are two ways to avoid this issue.

The first way is to use the `update_model_dir_path()` method to point the
ensemble to the new directory. The second, more generic way, is to create an
ensemble on the fly from the underlying models. To do so, we supply a list of
models, or paths to these models as the `object` argument for plot methods and
tabular export methods.

```{r, label="prospective-model-performance-plot-new-directory"}
# Generate paths to the model objects.
model_paths <- sapply(
  list.files(model_directory_path, pattern = "model"), 
  function(x) (file.path(model_directory_path, x)))

# Generate plot using an ad-hoc ensemble.
plots <- familiar::plot_model_performance(
  object = model_paths,
  draw = TRUE,
  facet_by = "metric",
  data = data[batch_id == "validation"],
  estimation_type = "bci",
  metric = c("auc", "accuracy"),
  familiar_data_names = "lasso"
)
```

# Customising exports and plots

Familiar also produces data and collection objects. Data objects hold the
processed evaluation data derived from a particular data set and are found in
the `familiar_data` folder.

```{r}
list.files(file.path(tempdir(), "familiar_data"))
```

In our example, we generated three data objects: one for internal development, one for internal validation, and one for
external validation data. These separate data objects are collected in a collection
object, which is found in the `familiar_collections` folder.

```{r}
list.files(file.path(tempdir(), "familiar_collections"))
```

There is typically only one collection in this location, but more may exist if
`summon_familiar` is called with `evaluate_top_level_only=FALSE`.

Note that data and collection objects are static. We cannot use them as flexibly
as models and ensembles. For example, we cannot assess different performance
metrics using the data stored in familiar data and collection objects or use
these objects to predict outcomes for new datasets. Below are exceptions to this
rule:

-   `export_fs_vimp`, `export_model_vimp`, and `plot_variable_importance` and
its derived methods (`plot_feature_selection_variable_importance`,
`plot_feature_selection_occurrence`, `plot_model_signature_variable_importance`
and `plot_model_signature_occurrence`) allow for specifying and altering feature
aggregation methods and thresholds.

-   `export_feature_similarity`, `export_sample_similarity`,
`export_feature_expression`, `plot_feature_similarity` and
`plot_sample_clustering` methods allow for specifying clustering arguments, but
not the similarity metric to assess distance between features. Internally, data
and collection objects store distance matrices.

The primary use of data and collection objects is for customising plotting. For
example, the AUC-ROC curves for each species are plotted using the default
palette in familiar, and a custom theme based on `cowplot::theme_cowplot`. We
can re-create the plot using the standard R palette, and a different theme to
alter its appearance.

```{r, label="prospective-auc_roc-plot"}
collection <- file.path(tempdir(), "familiar_collections", "pooled_data.RDS")

plots <- plot_auc_roc_curve(
  object = collection,
  ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_dark(),
  discrete_palette = "R4",
  draw = TRUE)
```

## Exporting collections

Generating plot data can take a non-trivial amount of time. Hence it may be
preferable to have the collection object available so that plots can be altered
and created more quickly. To do so, we can call an export or plot method with 
`export_collection=TRUE`.

```{r}
# Generate paths to the model objects.
model_paths <- sapply(
  list.files(model_directory_path, pattern = "model"),
  function(x) (file.path(model_directory_path, x))
)

# Generate plot data (plots + collection) using an ad-hoc ensemble.
plot_data <- familiar::plot_auc_roc_curve(
  object = model_paths,
  draw = FALSE,
  data = data[batch_id == "validation"],
  export_collection = TRUE)
```

The `plot_data` variable is a list that contains (here) two items: `collection`
and `plot_list`. The collection object can be used to alter plot elements, such
as the theme and palette.

```{r, label="prospective-auc_roc-plot-from-exported-collection"}
plots <- familiar::plot_auc_roc_curve(
  object = plot_data$collection,
  ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_dark(),
  discrete_palette = "R4",
  draw = TRUE)
```
