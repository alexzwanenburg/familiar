\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarCollection} object, or other other objects from which
a \code{familiarCollection} can be extracted. See details for more information.}

\item{feature_cluster_method}{The method used to perform clustering. These are
the same methods as for the \code{cluster_method} configuration parameter:
\code{none}, \code{hclust}, \code{agnes}, \code{diana} and \code{pam}.

\code{none} cannot be used when extracting data regarding mutual correlation or
feature expressions.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{feature_linkage_method}{The method used for agglomerative clustering in
\code{hclust} and \code{agnes}. These are the same methods as for the
\code{cluster_linkage_method} configuration parameter: \code{average}, \code{single},
\code{complete}, \code{weighted}, and \code{ward}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{feature_cluster_cut_method}{The method used to divide features into
separate clusters. The available methods are the same as for the
\code{cluster_cut_method} configuration parameter: \code{silhouette}, \code{fixed_cut} and
\code{dynamic_cut}.

\code{silhouette} is available for all cluster methods, but \code{fixed_cut} only
applies to methods that create hierarchical trees (\code{hclust}, \code{agnes} and
\code{diana}). \code{dynamic_cut} requires the \code{dynamicTreeCut} package and can only
be used with \code{agnes} and \code{hclust}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{feature_similarity_threshold}{The threshold level for pair-wise
similarity that is required to form feature clusters with the \code{fixed_cut}
method.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{draw}{(\emph{optional}) Draws the plot if TRUE.}

\item{dir_path}{(\emph{optional}) Path to the directory where created figures are
saved to. Output is saved in the \code{variable_importance} subdirectory. If NULL
no figures are saved, but are returned instead.}

\item{p_adjustment_method}{(\emph{optional}) Indicates type of p-value that is
shown. One of \code{holm}, \code{hochberg}, \code{hommel}, \code{bonferroni}, \code{BH}, \code{BY}, \code{fdr},
\code{none}, \code{p_value} or \code{q_value} for adjusted p-values, uncorrected p-values
and q-values. q-values may not be available.}

\item{split_by}{(\emph{optional}) Splitting variables. This refers to column names
on which datasets are split. A separate figure is created for each split.
See details for available variables.}

\item{color_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine fill colour of plot
objects. The variables cannot overlap with those provided to the \code{split_by}
argument, but may overlap with other arguments. See details for available
variables.}

\item{facet_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine how and if facets of
each figure appear. In case the \code{facet_wrap_cols} argument is \code{NULL}, the
first variable is used to define columns, and the remaing variables are
used to define rows of facets. The variables cannot overlap with those
provided to the \code{split_by} argument, but may overlap with other arguments.
See details for available variables.}

\item{facet_wrap_cols}{(\emph{optional}) Number of columns to generate when facet
wrapping. If NULL, a facet grid is produced instead.}

\item{show_cluster}{(\emph{optional}) Show which features were clustered together.}

\item{ggtheme}{(\emph{optional}) \code{ggplot} theme to use for plotting.}

\item{discrete_palette}{(\emph{optional}) Palette used to fill the bars in case a
non-singular variable was provided to the \code{color_by} argument.}

\item{gradient_palette}{(\emph{optional}) Palette to use for filling the bars in
case the \code{color_by} argument is not set. The bars are then coloured
according to their importance. By default, no gradient is used, and the bars
are not filled according to importance. Use \code{NULL} to fill the bars using
the default palette in \code{familiar}.}

\item{x_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the x-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

title is shown.}

\item{plot_sub_title}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure subtitle. If
NULL, no subtitle is shown.}

caption is shown.}

\item{x_range}{(\emph{optional}) Value range for the x-axis.}

\item{x_n_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Number of breaks to show on the x-axis of the
plot. \code{x_n_breaks} is used to determine the \code{x_breaks} argument in case it
is unset.}

\item{x_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Break points on the x-axis of the plot.}

\item{significance_level_shown}{Position(s) to draw vertical lines indicating
a significance level, e.g. 0.05. Can be NULL to not draw anything.}

\item{width}{(\emph{optional}) Width of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of facets.}

\item{height}{(\emph{optional}) Height of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of features and the number of facets.}

\item{units}{(\emph{optional}) Plot size unit. Either \code{cm} (default), \code{mm} or \verb{in}.}

\item{verbose}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided for the
plotting.}

"pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf" (windows only).}

between features. Similarity is computed in the same manner as for

\description{
This function plots the univariate analysis data stored in a
familiarCollection object.
}
\details{
This function generates a horizontal barplot with the length of the
bars corresponding to the 10-logarithm of the (multiple-testing corrected)
p-value or q-value.

Features are assessed univariately using one-sample location t-tests after
fitting a suitable regression model. The fitted model coefficient and the
covariance matrix are then used to compute a p-value.

The following splitting variables are available for \code{split_by}, \code{color_by}
and \code{facet_by}:
\itemize{
\item \code{fs_method}: feature selection methods
\item \code{learner}: learners
\item \code{data_set}: data sets
}

Unlike for plots of feature ranking in feature selection and after modelling
(as assessed by model-specific routines), clusters of features are now found
during creation of underlying \code{familiarData} objects, instead of through
consensus clustering. Hence, clustering results may differ due to
differences in the underlying datasets.

Available palettes for \code{discrete_palette} and \code{gradient_palette} are those
listed by \code{grDevices::palette.pals()} (requires R >= 4.0.0),
\code{grDevices::hcl.pals()} (requires R >= 3.6.0) and \code{rainbow}, \code{heat.colors},
\code{terrain.colors}, \code{topo.colors} and \code{cm.colors}, which correspond to the
palettes of the same name in \code{grDevices}. If not specified, a default
palette based on palettes in Tableau are used. You may also specify your own
palette by using colour names listed by \code{grDevices::colors()} or through
hexadecimal RGB strings.

Labelling methods such as \code{set_fs_method_names} or \code{set_feature_names} can
be applied to the \code{familiarCollection} object to update labels, and order
the output in the figure.
