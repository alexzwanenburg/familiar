\details{
Ensemble models created by familiar are often written to a directory
on a local drive or network. In such cases, the actual models are detached,
and paths to the models are stored instead. When the models are moved from
their original location, they can no longer be found and attached to the
ensemble. This method allows for pointing to the new directory containing
the models.
