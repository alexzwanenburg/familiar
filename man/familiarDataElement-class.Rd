\title{Data container for evaluation data.}
\description{
Most attributes of the familiarData object are objects of the
 familiarDataElement class. This (super-)class is used to allow for
 standardised aggregation and processing of evaluation data.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{data}}{Evaluation data, typically a data.table or list.}

\item{\code{identifiers}}{Identifiers of the data, e.g. the generating model name,
learner, etc.}

\item{\code{detail_level}}{Sets the level at which results are computed and
 aggregated.

 * `ensemble`: Results are computed at the ensemble level, i.e. over all
 models in the ensemble. This means that, for example, bias-corrected
 estimates of model performance are assessed by creating (at least) 20
 bootstraps and computing the model performance of the ensemble model for
 each bootstrap.

 * `hybrid` (default): Results are computed at the level of models in an
 ensemble. This means that, for example, bias-corrected estimates of model
 performance are directly computed using the models in the ensemble. If there
 are at least 20 trained models in the ensemble, performance is computed for
 each model, in contrast to `ensemble` where performance is computed for the
 ensemble of models. If there are less than 20 trained models in the
 ensemble, bootstraps are created so that at least 20 point estimates can be
 made.

 * `model`: Results are computed at the model level. This means that, for
 example, bias-corrected estimates of model performance are assessed by
 creating (at least) 20 bootstraps and computing the performance of the model
 for each bootstrap.

 Note that each level of detail has a different interpretation for bootstrap
 confidence intervals. For `ensemble` and `model` these are the confidence
 intervals for the ensemble and an individual model, respectively. That is,
 the confidence interval describes the range where an estimate produced by a
 respective ensemble or model trained on a repeat of the experiment may be
 found with the probability of the confidence level. For `hybrid`, it
 represents the range where any single model trained on a repeat of the
 experiment may be found with the probability of the confidence level. By
 definition, confidence intervals obtained using `hybrid` are at least as
 wide as those for `ensemble`. `hybrid` offers the correct interpretation if
 the goal of the analysis is to assess the result of a single, unspecified,
 model.

 Some child classes do not use this parameter.}

\item{\code{estimation_type}}{Sets the type of estimation that should be possible.
 This has the following options:

 * `point`: Point estimates.

 * `bias_correction` or `bc`: Bias-corrected estimates. A bias-corrected
 estimate is computed from (at least) 20 point estimates, and `familiar` may
 bootstrap the data to create them.

 * `bootstrap_confidence_interval` or `bci` (default): Bias-corrected
 estimates with bootstrap confidence intervals (Efron and Hastie, 2016). The
 number of point estimates required depends on the `confidence_level`
 parameter, and `familiar` may bootstrap the data to create them.

 Some child classes do not use this parameter.}

\item{\code{confidence_level}}{(*optional*) Numeric value for the level at which
confidence intervals are determined. In the case bootstraps are used to
determine the confidence intervals bootstrap estimation, `familiar` uses the
rule of thumb \eqn{n = 20 / ci.level} to determine the number of required
bootstraps.}

\item{\code{bootstrap_ci_method}}{Method used to determine bootstrap confidence
 intervals (Efron and Hastie, 2016). The following methods are implemented:

 * `percentile` (default): Confidence intervals obtained using the percentile
 method.

 * `bc`: Bias-corrected confidence intervals.

 Note that the standard method is not implemented because this method is
 often not suitable due to non-normal distributions. The bias-corrected and
 accelerated (BCa) method is not implemented yet.}

\item{\code{value_column}}{Identifies column(s) in the `data` attribute presenting
values.}

\item{\code{grouping_column}}{Identifies column(s) in the `data` attribute presenting
identifier columns for grouping during aggregation. Familiar will
automatically assign items from the `identifiers` attribute to the data and
this attribute when combining multiple familiarDataElements of the same
(child) class.}

\item{\code{is_aggregated}}{Defines whether the object was aggregated.}
