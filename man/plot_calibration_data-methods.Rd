    \item{\code{familiar_data_names}}{Names of the dataset(s). Only used if the \code{object}
parameter is one or more \code{familiarData} objects.}
    \item{\code{collection_name}}{Name of the collection.}
    \item{\code{device}}{Device to use. Can either be a device function
(e.g. \link{png}), or one of "eps", "ps", "tex" (pictex),
"pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf" (windows only). If
\code{NULL} (default), the device is guessed based on the \code{filename} extension.}
    \item{\code{scale}}{Multiplicative scaling factor.}
    \item{\code{dpi}}{Plot resolution. Also accepts a string input: "retina" (320),
"print" (300), or "screen" (72). Applies only to raster output types.}
    \item{\code{limitsize}}{When \code{TRUE} (the default), \code{ggsave()} will not
save images larger than 50x50 inches, to prevent the common error of
specifying dimensions in pixels.}
    \item{\code{bg}}{Background colour. If \code{NULL}, uses the \code{plot.background} fill value
from the plot theme.}
    \item{\code{create.dir}}{Whether to create new directories if a non-existing
directory is specified in the \code{filename} or \code{path} (\code{TRUE}) or return an
error (\code{FALSE}, default). If \code{FALSE} and run in an interactive session,
a prompt will appear asking to create a new directory when necessary.}
    \item{\code{data}}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are assessed.}
    \item{\code{is_pre_processed}}{Flag that indicates whether the data was already
pre-processed externally, e.g. normalised and clustered. Only used if the
\code{data} argument is a \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame}.}
    \item{\code{cl}}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallellisation.}
    \item{\code{evaluation_times}}{One or more time points that are used for in analysis
of survival problems when data has to be assessed at a set time, e.g.
calibration. If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from
settings used at creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects. Only
used for \code{survival} outcomes.}
    \item{\code{ensemble_method}}{Method for ensembling predictions from models for the
same sample. Available methods are:
\itemize{
\item \code{median} (default): Use the median of the predicted values as the ensemble
value for a sample.
\item \code{mean}: Use the mean of the predicted values as the ensemble value for a
sample.
}}
    \item{\code{verbose}}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{message_indent}}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{detail_level}}{(\emph{optional}) Sets the level at which results are computed
and aggregated.
\itemize{
\item \code{ensemble}: Results are computed at the ensemble level, i.e. over all
models in the ensemble. This means that, for example, bias-corrected
estimates of model performance are assessed by creating (at least) 20
bootstraps and computing the model performance of the ensemble model for
each bootstrap.
\item \code{hybrid} (default): Results are computed at the level of models in an
ensemble. This means that, for example, bias-corrected estimates of model
performance are directly computed using the models in the ensemble. If there
are at least 20 trained models in the ensemble, performance is computed for
each model, in contrast to \code{ensemble} where performance is computed for the
ensemble of models. If there are less than 20 trained models in the
ensemble, bootstraps are created so that at least 20 point estimates can be
made.
\item \code{model}: Results are computed at the model level. This means that, for
example, bias-corrected estimates of model performance are assessed by
creating (at least) 20 bootstraps and computing the performance of the model
for each bootstrap.
}

Note that each level of detail has a different interpretation for bootstrap
confidence intervals. For \code{ensemble} and \code{model} these are the confidence
intervals for the ensemble and an individual model, respectively. That is,
the confidence interval describes the range where an estimate produced by a
respective ensemble or model trained on a repeat of the experiment may be
found with the probability of the confidence level. For \code{hybrid}, it
represents the range where any single model trained on a repeat of the
experiment may be found with the probability of the confidence level. By
definition, confidence intervals obtained using \code{hybrid} are at least as
wide as those for \code{ensemble}. \code{hybrid} offers the correct interpretation if
the goal of the analysis is to assess the result of a single, unspecified,
model.

\code{hybrid} is generally computationally less expensive then \code{ensemble}, which
in turn is somewhat less expensive than \code{model}.

A non-default \code{detail_level} parameter can be specified for separate
evaluation steps by providing a parameter value in a named list with data
elements, e.g. \code{list("auc_data"="ensemble", "model_performance"="hybrid")}.
This parameter can be set for the following data elements: \code{auc_data},
\code{decision_curve_analyis}, \code{model_performance}, \code{permutation_vimp},
\code{ice_data}, \code{prediction_data} and \code{confusion_matrix}.}
    \item{\code{estimation_type}}{(\emph{optional}) Sets the type of estimation that should be
possible. This has the following options:
\itemize{
\item \code{point}: Point estimates.
\item \code{bias_correction} or \code{bc}: Bias-corrected estimates. A bias-corrected
estimate is computed from (at least) 20 point estimates, and \code{familiar} may
bootstrap the data to create them.
\item \code{bootstrap_confidence_interval} or \code{bci} (default): Bias-corrected
estimates with bootstrap confidence intervals (Efron and Hastie, 2016). The
number of point estimates required depends on the \code{confidence_level}
parameter, and \code{familiar} may bootstrap the data to create them.
}

As with \code{detail_level}, a non-default \code{estimation_type} parameter can be
specified for separate evaluation steps by providing a parameter value in a
named list with data elements, e.g. \code{list("auc_data"="bci", "model_performance"="point")}. This parameter can be set for the following
data elements: \code{auc_data}, \code{decision_curve_analyis}, \code{model_performance},
\code{permutation_vimp}, \code{ice_data}, and \code{prediction_data}.}
    \item{\code{aggregate_results}}{(\emph{optional}) Flag that signifies whether results
should be aggregated during evaluation. If \code{estimation_type} is
\code{bias_correction} or \code{bc}, aggregation leads to a single bias-corrected
estimate. If \code{estimation_type} is \code{bootstrap_confidence_interval} or \code{bci},
aggregation leads to a single bias-corrected estimate with lower and upper
boundaries of the confidence interval. This has no effect if
\code{estimation_type} is \code{point}.

The default value is equal to \code{TRUE} except when assessing metrics to assess
model performance, as the default violin plot requires underlying data.

As with \code{detail_level} and \code{estimation_type}, a non-default
\code{aggregate_results} parameter can be specified for separate evaluation steps
by providing a parameter value in a named list with data elements, e.g.
\code{list("auc_data"=TRUE, , "model_performance"=FALSE)}. This parameter exists
for the same elements as \code{estimation_type}.}
    \item{\code{confidence_level}}{(\emph{optional}) Numeric value for the level at which
confidence intervals are determined. In the case bootstraps are used to
determine the confidence intervals bootstrap estimation, \code{familiar} uses the
rule of thumb \eqn{n = 20 / ci.level} to determine the number of required
bootstraps.

The default value is \code{0.95}.}
    \item{\code{bootstrap_ci_method}}{(\emph{optional}) Method used to determine bootstrap
confidence intervals (Efron and Hastie, 2016). The following methods are
implemented:
\itemize{
\item \code{percentile} (default): Confidence intervals obtained using the percentile
method.
\item \code{bc}: Bias-corrected confidence intervals.
}

Note that the standard method is not implemented because this method is
often not suitable due to non-normal distributions. The bias-corrected and
accelerated (BCa) method is not implemented yet.}

\description{
This method creates calibration plots from calibration data
stored in a familiarCollection object. For this figures, the expected
(predicted) values are plotted against the observed values. A
well-calibrated model should be close to the identity line.
}
\details{
This function generates a calibration plot for each model in each
dataset. Any data used for calibration (e.g. baseline survival) is obtained
during model creation.

Available splitting variables are: \code{vimp_method}, \code{learner}, \code{data_set} and
\code{evaluation_time} (survival analysis only) and \code{positive_class} (multinomial
endpoints only). By default, separate figures are created for each
combination of \code{vimp_method} and \code{learner}, with facetting by \code{data_set}.

Calibration in survival analysis is performed at set time points so that
survival probabilities can be computed from the model, and compared with
observed survival probabilities. This is done differently depending on the
underlying model. For Cox partial hazards regression models, the base
survival (of the development samples) are used, whereas accelerated failure
time models (e.g. Weibull) and survival random forests can be used to
directly predict survival probabilities at a given time point. For survival
analysis, \code{evaluation_time} is an additional facet variable (by default).

Calibration for multinomial endpoints is performed in a one-against-all
manner. This yields calibration information for each individual class of the
endpoint. For such endpoints, \code{positive_class} is an additional facet variable
(by default).

Calibration plots have a density plot in the margin, which shows the density
of the plotted points, ordered by the expected probability or value. For
binomial and multinomial outcomes, the density for positive and negative
classes are shown separately. Note that this information is only provided in
when \code{color_by} is not used as a splitting variable (i.e. one calibration
plot per facet).

Calibration plots are annotated with the intercept and the slope of a linear
model fitted to the sample points. A well-calibrated model has an intercept
close to 0.0 and a slope of 1.0. Intercept and slope are shown with their
respective 95\% confidence intervals. In addition, goodness-of-fit tests may
be shown. For most endpoints these are based on the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL)
test, but for survival endpoints both the Nam-D'Agostino (ND) and the
Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino (GND) tests are shown. Note that this information
is only annotated when \code{color_by} is not used as a splitting variable (i.e.
one calibration plot per facet).

Labelling methods such as \code{set_risk_group_names} or \code{set_data_set_names} can
be applied to the \code{familiarCollection} object to update labels, and order
the output in the figure.
