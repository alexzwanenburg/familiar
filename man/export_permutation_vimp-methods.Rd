\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarCollection} object, or other other objects from which
a \code{familiarCollection} can be extracted. See details for more information.}

\item{dir_path}{Path to folder where extracted data should be saved. \code{NULL}
will allow export as a structured list of data.tables.}

  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=extract_permutation_vimp]{extract_permutation_vimp}}, \code{\link[=as_familiar_collection]{as_familiar_collection}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{data}}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are used to compute}
    \item{\code{cl}}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallelisation.}
    \item{\code{ensemble_method}}{Method for ensembling predictions from models for the
same sample. Available methods are:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: Use the mean of the predicted values as the ensemble value for a
sample.
}}
    \item{\code{feature_cluster_method}}{The method used to perform clustering. These are
the same methods as for the \code{cluster_method} configuration parameter:
\code{none}, \code{hclust}, \code{agnes}, \code{diana} and \code{pam}.

\code{none} cannot be used when extracting data regarding mutual correlation or
feature expressions.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{feature_linkage_method}}{The method used for agglomerative clustering in
\code{hclust} and \code{agnes}. These are the same methods as for the
\code{cluster_linkage_method} configuration parameter: \code{average}, \code{single},
\code{complete}, \code{weighted}, and \code{ward}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{feature_cluster_cut_method}}{The method used to divide features into
separate clusters. The available methods are the same as for the
\code{cluster_cut_method} configuration parameter: \code{silhouette}, \code{fixed_cut} and
\code{dynamic_cut}.

\code{silhouette} is available for all cluster methods, but \code{fixed_cut} only
applies to methods that create hierarchical trees (\code{hclust}, \code{agnes} and
\code{diana}). \code{dynamic_cut} requires the \code{dynamicTreeCut} package and can only
be used with \code{agnes} and \code{hclust}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{feature_similarity_metric}}{Metric to determine pairwise similarity
between features. Similarity is computed in the same manner as for
clustering, and \code{feature_similarity_metric} therefore has the same options
as \code{cluster_similarity_metric}: \code{mcfadden_r2}, \code{cox_snell_r2},
\code{nagelkerke_r2}, \code{spearman}, \code{kendall} and \code{pearson}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{feature_similarity_threshold}}{The threshold level for pair-wise
similarity that is required to form feature clusters with the \code{fixed_cut}
method.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{metric}}{One or more metrics for assessing model performance. See the
vignette on performance metrics for the available metrics. If not provided
explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at creation of the
underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{eval_times}}{One or more time points that are used for assessing
calibration in survival problems. This is done as expected and observed
survival probabilities depend on time. If not provided explicitly, this
parameter is read from settings used at creation of the underlying
\code{familiarModel} objects. Only used for \code{survival} outcomes.}
    \item{\code{detail_level}}{(\emph{optional}) Sets the level at which results are computed
and aggregated.
\itemize{
\item \code{ensemble}: Results are computed at the ensemble level, i.e. over all
models in the ensemble. This means that, for example, bias-corrected
estimates of model performance are assessed by creating (at least) 20
bootstraps and computing the model performance of the ensemble model for
each bootstrap.
\item \code{hybrid} (default): Results are computed at the level of models in an
ensemble. This means that, for example, bias-corrected estimates of model
performance are directly computed using the models in the ensemble. If there
are at least 20 trained models in the ensemble, performance is computed for
each model, in contrast to \code{ensemble} where performance is computed for the
ensemble of models. If there are less than 20 trained models in the
ensemble, bootstraps are created so that at least 20 point estimates can be
made.
\item \code{model} (to be implemented): Results are computed at the model level. This
means that, for example, bias-corrected estimates of model performance are
assessed by creating (at least) 20 bootstraps and computing the performance
of the model for each bootstrap.
}

Note that each level of detail has a different interpretation for bootstrap
confidence intervals. For \code{ensemble} and \code{model} these are the confidence
intervals for the ensemble and an individual model, respectively. That is,
the confidence interval describes the range where an estimate produced by a
respective ensemble or model trained on a repeat of the experiment may be
found with the probability of the confidence level. For \code{hybrid}, it
represents the range where any single model trained on a repeat of the
experiment may be found with the probability of the confidence level. By
definition, confidence intervals obtained using \code{hybrid} are at least as
wide as those for \code{ensemble}. \code{hybrid} offers the correct interpretation if
the goal of the analysis is to assess the result of a single, unspecified,
model.

\code{hybrid} is generally computationally less expensive then \code{ensemble}, which
in turn is somewhat less expensive than \code{model}.

A non-default \code{detail_level} parameter can be
specified for separate evaluation steps by providing a parameter value in a
named list with data elements, e.g. \code{list("auc_data"="ensemble", "model_performance"="hybrid")}. This parameter can be set for the following
data elements: \code{auc_data}, \code{decision_curve_data}, \code{model_performance},
\code{permutation_vimp}, \code{prediction_data} and \code{confusion_matrix}.}
    \item{\code{estimation_type}}{(\emph{optional}) Sets the type of estimation that should be
possible. This has the following options:
\itemize{
\item \code{point}: Point estimates.
\item \code{bias_correction} or \code{bc}: Bias-corrected estimates. A bias-corrected
estimate is computed from (at least) 20 point estimates, and \code{familiar} may
bootstrap the data to create them.
\item \code{bootstrap_confidence_interval} or \code{bci} (default): Bias-corrected
estimates with bootstrap confidence intervals (Efron and Hastie, 2016). The
number of point estimates required depends on the \code{confidence_level}
parameter, and \code{familiar} may bootstrap the data to create them. In some
cases no bootstrap data
}

As with \code{detail_level}, a non-default \code{estimation_type} parameter can be
specified for separate evaluation steps by providing a parameter value in a
named list with data elements, e.g. \code{list("auc_data"="bci", "model_performance"="point")}. This parameter can be set for the following
data elements: \code{auc_data}, \code{decision_curve_data}, \code{model_performance},
\code{permutation_vimp}, and \code{prediction_data}.}
    \item{\code{aggregate_results}}{(\emph{optional}) Flag that signifies whether results
should be aggregated during evaluation. If \code{estimation_type} is
\code{bias_correction} or \code{bc}, aggregation leads to a single bias-corrected
estimate. If \code{estimation_type} is \code{bootstrap_confidence_interval} or \code{bci},
aggregation leads to a single bias-corrected estimate with lower and upper
boundaries of the confidence interval. This has no effect if
\code{estimation_type} is \code{point}.

The default value is equal to \code{TRUE} except when assessing metrics to assess
model performance, as the default violin plot requires underlying data.

As with \code{detail_level} and \code{estimation_type}, a non-default
\code{aggregate_results} parameter can be specified for separate evaluation steps
by providing a parameter value in a named list with data elements, e.g.
\code{list("auc_data"=TRUE, , "model_performance"=FALSE)}. This parameter exists
for the same elements as \code{estimation_type}.}
    \item{\code{confidence_level}}{(\emph{optional}) Numeric value for the level at which
confidence intervals are determined. In the case bootstraps are used to
determine the confidence intervals bootstrap estimation, \code{familiar} uses the
rule of thumb \eqn{n = 20 / ci.level} to determine the number of required
bootstraps.

The default value is \code{0.95}.}
    \item{\code{bootstrap_ci_method}}{(\emph{optional}) Method used to determine bootstrap
confidence intervals (Efron and Hastie, 2016). The following methods are
implemented:
\itemize{
\item \code{percentile} (default): Confidence intervals obtained using the percentile
method.
\item \code{bc}: Bias-corrected confidence intervals.
}

Note that the standard method is not implemented because this method is
often not suitable due to non-normal distributions. The bias-corrected and
accelerated (BCa) method is not implemented yet.}
    \item{\code{is_pre_processed}}{Flag that indicates whether the data was already
pre-processed externally, e.g. normalised and clustered. Only used if the
\code{data} argument is a \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame}.}
    \item{\code{message_indent}}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{verbose}}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{familiar_data_names}}{Names of the dataset(s). Only used if the \code{object} parameter
is one or more \code{familiarData} objects.}
    \item{\code{collection_name}}{Name of the collection.}
  }}
}
\value{
A data.table (if \code{dir_path} is not provided), or nothing, as all data
is exported to \code{csv} files.

\description{
Extract and export model-based variable importance from a
familiarCollection.
}
\details{
Data, such as permutation variable importance and calibration
information, is usually collected from a \code{familiarCollection} object.
However, you can also provide one or more \code{familiarData} objects, that will
be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object. It is also
possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more \code{familiarModel}
objects together with the data from which data is computed prior to export.
Paths to the previously mentioned files can also be provided.

All parameters aside from \code{object} and \code{dir_path} are only used if \code{object}
is not a \code{familiarCollection} object, or a path to one.

Permutation Variable importance assesses the improvement in model
performance due to a feature. For this purpose, the performance of the model
is measured as normal, and is measured again with a dataset where the values
of the feature in question have been randomly permuted. The difference
between both performance measurements is the permutation variable
importance.

In familiar, this basic concept is extended in several ways:
\itemize{
\item Point estimates of variable importance are based on multiple (21) random
permutations. The difference between model performance on the normal dataset
and the median performance measurement of the randomly permuted datasets is
used as permutation variable importance.
\item Confidence intervals for the ensemble model are determined using bootstrap
methods.
\item Permutation variable importance is assessed for any metric specified using
the \code{metric} argument.
\item Permutation variable importance can take into account similarity between
features and permute similar features simultaneously.
