familiarCollection objects collect data from one or more familiarData
objects. This objects are important, as all plotting and export functions use
it. The fact that one can supply familiarModel, familiarEnsemble and
familiarData objects as arguments for these methods, is because familiar
internally converts these into familiarCollection objects prior to executing
the method.}
