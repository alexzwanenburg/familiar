\arguments{
\item{data}{data.table with feature data}

\item{sample_id_column}{(\strong{recommended}) Name of the column containing
sample or subject identifiers. See \code{batch_id_column} above for more
details.

If unset, every row will be identified as a single sample.}

\item{batch_id_column}{(\strong{recommended}) Name of the column containing batch
or cohort identifiers. This parameter is required if more than one dataset
is provided, or if external validation is performed.

In familiar any row of data is organised by four identifiers:
\itemize{
\item The batch identifier \code{batch_id_column}: This denotes the group to which a
set of samples belongs, e.g. patients from a single study, samples measured
in a batch, etc. The batch identifier is used for batch normalisation, as
well as selection of development and validation datasets.
\item The sample identifier \code{sample_id_column}: This denotes the sample level,
e.g. data from a single individual. Subsets of data, e.g. bootstraps or
cross-validation folds, are created at this level.
\item The series identifier \code{series_id_column}: Indicates measurements on a
single sample that may not share the same outcome value, e.g. a time
series, or the number of cells in a view.
\item The repetition identifier: Indicates repeated measurements in a single
series where any feature values may differ, but the outcome does not.
Repetition identifiers are always implicitly set when multiple entries for
the same series of the same sample in the same batch that share the same
outcome are encountered.
}}

\item{series_id_column}{(\strong{optional}) Name of the column containing series
identifiers, which distinguish between measurements that are part of a
series for a single sample. See \code{batch_id_column} above for more details.

If unset, rows which share the same batch and sample identifiers but have a
different outcome are assigned unique series identifiers.}

\item{outcome_column}{(\strong{recommended}) Name of the column containing the
outcome of interest. May be identified from a formula, if a formula is
provided as an argument. Otherwise an error is raised. Note that \code{survival}
and \code{competing_risk} outcome type outcomes require two columns that
indicate the time-to-event or the time of last follow-up and the event
status.}

\item{outcome_type}{(\strong{recommended}) Type of outcome found in the outcome
column. The outcome type determines many aspects of the overall process,
e.g. the available feature selection methods and learners, but also the
type of assessments that can be conducted to evaluate the resulting models.
Implemented outcome types are:
\itemize{
\item \code{binomial}: categorical outcome with 2 levels.
\item \code{multinomial}: categorical outcome with 2 or more levels.
\item \code{count}: Poisson-distributed numeric outcomes.
\item \code{continuous}: general continuous numeric outcomes.
\item \code{survival}: survival outcome for time-to-event data.
}

If not provided, the algorithm will attempt to obtain outcome_type from
contents of the outcome column. This may lead to unexpected results, and we
therefore advise to provide this information manually.

Note that \code{competing_risk} survival analysis are not fully supported, and
is currently not a valid choice for \code{outcome_type}.}

\item{include_features}{(\emph{optional}) Feature columns that are specifically
included in the data set. By default all features are included. Cannot
overlap with \code{exclude_features}, but may overlap \code{signature}. Features in
\code{signature} and \code{novelty_features} are always included. If both
\code{exclude_features} and \code{include_features} are provided, \code{include_features}
takes precedence, provided that there is no overlap between the two.}

\item{class_levels}{(\emph{optional}) Class levels for \code{binomial} or \code{multinomial}
outcomes. This argument can be used to specify the ordering of levels for
categorical outcomes. These class levels must exactly match the levels
present in the outcome column.}

\item{censoring_indicator}{(\strong{recommended}) Indicator for right-censoring in
\code{survival} and \code{competing_risk} analyses. \code{familiar} will automatically
recognise \code{0}, \code{false}, \code{f}, \code{n}, \code{no} as censoring indicators, including
different capitalisations. If this parameter is set, it replaces the
default values.}

\item{event_indicator}{(\strong{recommended}) Indicator for events in \code{survival}
and \code{competing_risk} analyses. \code{familiar} will automatically recognise \code{1},
\code{true}, \code{t}, \code{y} and \code{yes} as event indicators, including different
capitalisations. If this parameter is set, it replaces the default values.}

\item{competing_risk_indicator}{(\strong{recommended}) Indicator for competing
risks in \code{competing_risk} analyses. There are no default values, and if
unset, all values other than those specified by the \code{event_indicator} and
\code{censoring_indicator} parameters are considered to indicate competing
risks.}

\item{check_stringency}{Specifies stringency of various checks. This is mostly:
\itemize{
\item \code{strict}: default value used for \code{summon_familiar}. Thoroughly checks
input data. Used internally for checking development data.
\item \code{external_warn}: value used for \code{extract_data} and related methods. Less
stringent checks, but will warn for possible issues. Used internally for
checking data for evaluation and explanation.
\item \code{external}: value used for external methods such as \code{predict}. Less
stringent checks, particularly for identifier and outcome columns, which may
be completely absent. Used internally for \code{predict}.
}}

\item{reference_method}{(\emph{optional}) Method used to set reference levels for
categorical features. There are several options:
\itemize{
\item \code{auto} (default): Categorical features that are not explicitly set by the
user, i.e. columns containing boolean values or characters, use the most
frequent level as reference. Categorical features that are explicitly set,
i.e. as factors, are used as is.
\item \code{always}: Both automatically detected and user-specified categorical
features have the reference level set to the most frequent level. Ordinal
features are not altered, but are used as is.
\item \code{never}: User-specified categorical features are used as is.
Automatically detected categorical features are simply sorted, and the
first level is then used as the reference level. This was the behaviour
prior to familiar version 1.3.0.

\description{
Internal function for finalising generic data processing
}
\details{
This function is used to update data.table provided by loading the
data. When part of the main familiar workflow, this function is used after
.parse_initial_settings --> .load_data --> .update_initial_settings.

When used to parse external data (e.g. in conjunction with familiarModel)
it follows after .load_data. Hence the function contains several checks
which are otherwise part of .update_initial_settings.
