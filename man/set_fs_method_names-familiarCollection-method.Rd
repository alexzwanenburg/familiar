\title{Rename feature selection methods for plotting and export}
\usage{
\S4method{set_fs_method_names}{familiarCollection}(x, old = NULL, new, order = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A familiarCollection object.}

\item{old}{(optional) Set of old labels to replace.}

\item{new}{Set of replacement labels. The number of replacement labels should be equal to the number of provided old labels or the full number of labels.
If a subset of labels is to be replaced, both \code{old} and \code{new} should be provided.}

\item{order}{(optional) Ordered set of replacement labels. This is used to provide the order
in which the labels should be placed, which affects e.g. levels in a plot. If the ordering is not explicitly provided,
and \code{new} matches the total number of labels in length, the ordering of \code{new} is used to order the table.}
}
\value{
A familiarCollection object with updated labels.
}
\description{
Tabular exports and figures created from a familiarCollection object can be customised by providing names for the feature selection methods.
}
\details{
Labels convert the internal naming for feature selection methods to the requested label at export or when plotting. This enables the use of
more specific naming, e.g. changing \code{mim} to \code{Mutual Information Maximisation}. Currently assigned labels
can be found using the \code{get_fs_method_names} method.
