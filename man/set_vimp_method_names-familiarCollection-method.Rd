\title{Rename variable importance methods for plotting and export}
\usage{
\S4method{set_vimp_method_names}{familiarCollection}(x, old = NULL, new = NULL, order = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A familiarCollection object.}

\item{old}{(optional) Set of old labels to replace.}

\item{new}{Set of replacement labels. The number of replacement labels should
be equal to the number of provided old labels or the full number of labels.
If a subset of labels is to be replaced, both \code{old} and \code{new}
should be provided.}

\item{order}{(optional) Ordered set of replacement labels. This is used to
provide the order in which the labels should be placed, which affects e.g.
levels in a plot. If the ordering is not explicitly provided, the old
ordering is used.}
}
\value{
A familiarCollection object with updated labels.
}
\description{
Tabular exports and figures created from a familiarCollection
object can be customised by providing names for the variable importance
methods.
}
\details{
Labels convert the internal naming for variable importance methods
to the requested label at export or when plotting. This enables the use of
more specific naming, e.g. changing \code{mim} to \code{Mutual Information
  Maximisation}. Currently assigned labels can be found using the
\code{get_vimp_method_names} method.
