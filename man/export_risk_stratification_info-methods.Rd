\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarCollection} object, or other other objects from which
a \code{familiarCollection} can be extracted. See details for more information.}

\item{dir_path}{Path to folder where extracted data should be saved. \code{NULL}
will allow export as a structured list of data.tables.}

\item{aggregate_results}{Flag that signifies whether results should be
aggregated for export.}

  \describe{
    \item{\code{familiar_data_names}}{Names of the dataset(s). Only used if the \code{object} parameter
is one or more \code{familiarData} objects.}
    \item{\code{collection_name}}{Name of the collection.}

}
\value{
A data.table (if \code{dir_path} is not provided), or nothing, as all data
is exported to \code{csv} files.
}

Extract and export cut-off values for risk group stratification
by models in a familiarCollection.

\details{
Data is usually collected from a \code{familiarCollection} object.
However, you can also provide one or more \code{familiarData} objects, that will
be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object. It is also
possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more \code{familiarModel}
objects together with the data from which data is computed prior to export.
Paths to the previous files can also be provided.

All parameters aside from \code{object} and \code{dir_path} are only used if \code{object}
is not a \code{familiarCollection} object, or a path to one.

Stratification cut-off values are determined when creating a model, using
one of several methods set by the \code{stratification_method} parameter. These
values are then used to stratify samples in any new dataset. The available
methods are:
\itemize{
\item \code{median} (default): The median predicted value in the development cohort
is used to stratify the samples into two risk groups.
\item \code{fixed}: Samples are stratified based on the sample quantiles of the
predicted values. These quantiles are defined using the
\code{stratification_threshold} parameter.
\item \code{optimised}: Use maximally selected rank statistics to determine the
optimal threshold (Lausen and Schumacher, 1992; Hothorn et al., 2003) to
stratify samples into two optimally separated risk groups.
