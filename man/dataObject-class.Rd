\title{Data object}
\description{
The dataObject class is used to resolve the issue of keeping track of
pre-processing status and data loading inside complex workflows, e.g. nested
predict functions inside a calibration function.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{data}}{NULL or data table containing the data. This is the data which
will be read and used.}

\item{\code{preprocessing_level}}{character indicating the level of pre-processing
already conducted.}

\item{\code{outcome_type}}{character, determines the outcome type.}

\item{\code{outcome_info}}{Outcome information object, which contains additional
information concerning the outcome, such as class levels.}

\item{\code{data_column_info}}{Object containing column information.}

\item{\code{delay_loading}}{logical. Allows delayed loading data, which enables data
parsing downstream without additional workflow complexity or memory
utilisation.}

\item{\code{perturb_level}}{numeric. This is the perturbation level for data which
has not been loaded. Used for data retrieval by interacting with the run
table of the accompanying model.}

\item{\code{load_validation}}{logical. This determines which internal data set will
be loaded. If TRUE, the validation data will be loaded, whereas FALSE loads
the development data.}

\item{\code{aggregate_on_load}}{logical. Determines whether data is aggregated after
loading.}

\item{\code{sample_set_on_load}}{NULL or vector of sample identifiers to be loaded.}
