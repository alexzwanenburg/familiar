\title{Rename risk groups for plotting and export}
\usage{
\S4method{set_risk_group_names}{familiarCollection}(x, old = NULL, new, order = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A familiarCollection object.}

\item{old}{(optional) Set of old labels to replace.}

\item{new}{Set of replacement labels. The number of replacement labels should be equal to the number of provided old labels or the full number of labels.
If a subset of labels is to be replaced, both \code{old} and \code{new} should be provided.}

\item{order}{(optional) Ordered set of replacement labels. This is used to provide the order
in which the labels should be placed, which affects e.g. levels in a plot. If the ordering is not explicitly provided,
and \code{new} matches the total number of labels in length, the ordering of \code{new} is used to order the table.}
}
\value{
A familiarCollection object with updated labels.
}
\description{
Tabular exports and figures created from a familiarCollection object can be customised by providing names for risk groups in survival analysis.
}
\details{
Labels convert the internal naming for risk groups to the requested label at export or when plotting. This enables customisation of risk group names.
Currently assigned labels can be found using the \code{get_risk_group_names} method.
