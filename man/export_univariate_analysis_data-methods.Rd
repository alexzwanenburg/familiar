\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarCollection} object, or other other objects from which
a \code{familiarCollection} can be extracted. See details for more information.}

\item{dir_path}{Path to folder where extracted data should be saved. \code{NULL}
will allow export as a structured list of data.tables.}

\item{p_adjustment_method}{(\emph{optional}) Indicates type of p-value that is
shown. One of \code{holm}, \code{hochberg}, \code{hommel}, \code{bonferroni}, \code{BH}, \code{BY}, \code{fdr},
\code{none}, \code{p_value} or \code{q_value} for adjusted p-values, uncorrected p-values
and q-values. q-values may not be available.}

\item{export_collection}{(\emph{optional}) Exports the collection if TRUE.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=extract_univariate_analysis]{extract_univariate_analysis}}, \code{\link[=as_familiar_collection]{as_familiar_collection}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{data}}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are assessed.}
    \item{\code{cl}}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallellisation.}
    \item{\code{feature_cluster_method}}{The method used to perform clustering. These are
the same methods as for the \code{cluster_method} configuration parameter:
\code{none}, \code{hclust}, \code{agnes}, \code{diana} and \code{pam}.

\code{none} cannot be used when extracting data regarding mutual correlation or
feature expressions.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{feature_linkage_method}}{The method used for agglomerative clustering in
\code{hclust} and \code{agnes}. These are the same methods as for the
\code{cluster_linkage_method} configuration parameter: \code{average}, \code{single},
\code{complete}, \code{weighted}, and \code{ward}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{feature_cluster_cut_method}}{The method used to divide features into
separate clusters. The available methods are the same as for the
\code{cluster_cut_method} configuration parameter: \code{silhouette}, \code{fixed_cut} and
\code{dynamic_cut}.

\code{silhouette} is available for all cluster methods, but \code{fixed_cut} only
applies to methods that create hierarchical trees (\code{hclust}, \code{agnes} and
\code{diana}). \code{dynamic_cut} requires the \code{dynamicTreeCut} package and can only
be used with \code{agnes} and \code{hclust}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{feature_similarity_threshold}}{The threshold level for pair-wise
similarity that is required to form feature clusters with the \code{fixed_cut}
method.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{feature_similarity_metric}}{Metric to determine pairwise similarity
between features. Similarity is computed in the same manner as for
clustering, and \code{feature_similarity_metric} therefore has the same options
as \code{cluster_similarity_metric}: \code{mcfadden_r2}, \code{cox_snell_r2},
\code{nagelkerke_r2}, \code{spearman}, \code{kendall} and \code{pearson}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{icc_type}}{String indicating the type of intraclass correlation
coefficient (\code{1}, \code{2} or \code{3}) that should be used to compute robustness for
features in repeated measurements during the evaluation of univariate
importance. These types correspond to the types in Shrout and Fleiss (1979).
If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{verbose}}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{message_indent}}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{familiar_data_names}}{Names of the dataset(s). Only used if the \code{object} parameter
is one or more \code{familiarData} objects.}
    \item{\code{collection_name}}{Name of the collection.}
  }}
}
\value{
A data.table (if \code{dir_path} is not provided), or nothing, as
all data is exported to \code{csv} files.
}
\description{
Extract and export univariate analysis data of features for data
in a familiarCollection.
}
\details{
Data is usually collected from a \code{familiarCollection} object.
However, you can also provide one or more \code{familiarData} objects, that will
be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object. It is also
possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more \code{familiarModel}
objects together with the data from which data is computed prior to export.
Paths to the previous files can also be provided.

All parameters aside from \code{object} and \code{dir_path} are only used if \code{object}
is not a \code{familiarCollection} object, or a path to one.

Univariate analysis includes the computation of p and q-values, as well as
robustness (in case of repeated measurements). p-values are derived from
Wald's test.
